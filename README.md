This project was implemented to follow guidelines instructed by an indroduction to UX/UX course. Our goal was to create an easy-to-use program, which allowes users to quickly write down notes and reminders related to everyday aspects to stay organized. The motive behind creating a to-do list/notes website is to provide users with a simple and efficient way to manage and keep track of their tasks, notes, or any other type of information they need to remember. We aimed on making the task of staying organized and on top of tasks as simple and stress-free as possible for users, so that they can focus on what's most important and get more done.
